            <h2>How do we do it?</h2>
            <p>Every year there are thousands of car crashes at intersections all over LA. 
                Some intersections are more dangerous than others, but determining what makes an intersection 
                risky is a challenging problem. One intersection might be safe except in the evening when the sun 
                shines in drivers' faces. Another might be dangerous at all hours because of obstructions to vision. 
                There are many factors that can make driving risky. Our machine learning algorithm looks at all of the 
                nearly half-million crashes that have happened in LA since 2000  and identifies the factors that make an
                 intersection dangerous. Users can use our analysis to make their commute safer.</p>
